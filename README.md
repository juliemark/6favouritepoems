        <h2>I carry your heart with me:</h2>
        <h4>By E. E. Cummings</h4>
        <p>I carry your heart with me (I carry it in <br>
my heart) I am never without it (anywhere <br>
I go you go, my dear; and whatever is done <br>
by only me is your doing, my darling) <br> </p><p>
I fear 
no fate (for you are my fate, my sweet) I want <br>
no world (for beautiful you are my world, my true) <br>
and it's you are whatever a moon has always meant <br>
and whatever a sun will always sing is you
<br> </p><p>
Here is the deepest secret nobody knows <br>
(here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud <br>
and the sky of the sky of a tree called life;which grows <br>
higher than the soul can hope or mind can hide) <br>
and this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apart <br>

i carry your heart(i carry it in my heart)</p>

    <h2>I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud:</h2>
    <h4>by William Wordsworth</h4>
    <p>I wandered lonely as a cloud <br>
That floats on high o'er vales and hills, <br>
When all at once I saw a crowd, <br>
A host, of golden daffodils; <br>
Beside the lake, beneath the trees, <br>
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze. <br>
</p><p>
Continuous as the stars that shine <br>
And twinkle on the milky way, <br>
They stretched in never-ending line <br>
Along the margin of a bay: <br>
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,<br>
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.<br>
</p><p>
The waves beside them danced, but they<br>
Out-did the sparkling leaves in glee;<br>
A poet could not be but gay,<br>
In such a jocund company!<br>
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought<br>
What wealth the show to me had brought:<br>
</p><p>
For oft, when on my couch I lie<br>
In vacant or in pensive mood,<br>
They flash upon that inward eye<br>
Which is the bliss of solitude;<br>
And then my heart with pleasure fills,<br>
And dances with the daffodils.</p>

    <h2>Alone:</h2>
    <h4>Edgar Allan Poe</h4>
    <p>From childhood's hour I have not been <br>
As others were -- I have not seen<br>
As others saw -- I could not bring<br>
My passions from a common spring <br>
From the same source I have not taken<br>
My sorrow -- I could not awaken<br>
My heart to joy at the same tone <br>
And all I lov'd -- I lov'd alone <br>
Then -- in my childhood -- in the dawn<br>
Of a most stormy life -- was drawn<br>
From ev'ry depth of good and ill<br>
The mystery which binds me still <br>
From the torrent, or the fountain <br>
From the red cliff of the mountain <br>
From the sun that 'round me roll'd<br>
In its autumn tint of gold <br>
From the lightning in the sky<br>
As it pass'd me flying by <br>
From the thunder, and the storm <br>
And the cloud that took the form<br>
(When the rest of Heaven was blue)<br>
Of a demon in my view --

   <h2>The Road Not Taken:</h2>
   <h4>Robert Frost</h4>
   <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, <br>
And sorry I could not travel both<br>
And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
And looked down one as far as I could<br>
To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br>
</p><p>
Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
Though as for that the passing there<br>
Had worn them really about the same,<br>
</p><p>
And both that morning equally lay<br>
In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
I doubted if I should ever come back.<br>
</p><p>
I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—<br>
I took the one less traveled by,<br>
And that has made all the difference.</p>

    <h1>A Dream Within a Dream:</h1>
    <h4>Edgar Allan Poe</h4>
    <p>Take this kiss upon the brow!<br>
And, in parting from you now,<br>
Thus much let me avow —<br>
You are not wrong, who deem<br>
That my days have been a dream;<br>
Yet if hope has flown away<br>
In a night, or in a day,<br>
In a vision, or in none,<br>
Is it therefore the less gone?<br>  
All that we see or seem<br>
Is but a dream within a dream.<br>
</p><p>
I stand amid the roar<br>
Of a surf-tormented shore,<br>
And I hold within my hand<br>
Grains of the golden sand —<br>
How few! yet how they creep<br>
Through my fingers to the deep,<br>
While I weep — while I weep!<br>
O God! Can I not grasp <br>
Them with a tighter clasp?<br>
O God! can I not save<br>
One from the pitiless wave?<br>
Is all that we see or seem<br>
But a dream within a dream?<br>

<h1>The Charge of the Light Brigade:</h1>
<h4>Alfred Lord Tennyson</h4>
<p>
    I <br>
Half a league, half a league,<br>
Half a league onward,<br>
All in the valley of Death<br>
   Rode the six hundred.<br>
“Forward, the Light Brigade!<br>
Charge for the guns!” he said.<br>
Into the valley of Death<br>
   Rode the six hundred.<br>
</p><p>
II<br>
“Forward, the Light Brigade!”<br>
Was there a man dismayed?<br>
Not though the soldier knew<br>
   Someone had blundered.<br>
   Theirs not to make reply,<br>
   Theirs not to reason why,<br>
   Theirs but to do and die.<br>
   Into the valley of Death<br>
   Rode the six hundred.<br>
</p><p>
III<br>
Cannon to right of them,<br>
Cannon to left of them,<br>
Cannon in front of them<br>
   Volleyed and thundered;<br>
Stormed at with shot and shell,<br>
Boldly they rode and well,<br>
Into the jaws of Death,<br>
Into the mouth of hell<br>
   Rode the six hundred.<br>
</p><p>
IV<br>
Flashed all their sabres bare,<br>
Flashed as they turned in air<br>
Sabring the gunners there,<br>
Charging an army, while<br>
   All the world wondered.<br>
Plunged in the battery-smoke<br>
Right through the line they broke;<br>
Cossack and Russian<br>
Reeled from the sabre stroke<br>
   Shattered and sundered.<br>
Then they rode back, but not<br>
   Not the six hundred.<br>
</p><p>
V<br>
Cannon to right of them,<br>
Cannon to left of them,<br>
Cannon behind them<br>
   Volleyed and thundered;<br>
Stormed at with shot and shell,<br>
While horse and hero fell.<br>
They that had fought so well<br>
Came through the jaws of Death,<br>
Back from the mouth of hell,<br>
All that was left of them,<br>
   Left of six hundred.<br>
</p><p>
VI<br>
When can their glory fade?<br>
O the wild charge they made!<br>
   All the world wondered.<br>
Honour the charge they made!<br>
Honour the Light Brigade,<br>
   Noble six hundred!<br>
